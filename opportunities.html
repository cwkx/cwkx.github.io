  <h2 id="projects">PhD Projects</h2>
  <p>We're looking for potential PhD students to join our group. These are two interresting research questions, one from DL and the other from RL respectively:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>How do we approach generative modelling?</em></li>
    <ul>
      <li>There are curently about 7 equation classes in the generative modelling literature, most of which estimate the probability of data. Each related modelling approach (GANs, Flows, VAEs, Diffusion, OT, Autoregressive) have trade-offs in terms of (i) modelling quality, (i) inference time/depth, and (iii) distribution coverage/mode collapse. In the future, I think we will have richer theoretical insight into these trade-offs, and more adaptive and expressive ways to model distributions of data.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><em>How do we decide what to do?</em></li>
    <ul>
      <li>As humans, we set our own goals and discover knowledge without depending on environment reward. Intelligent people don't sit in front of the TV all day; they are active and constantly explore at the fringes of their knowledge while developing new skills. How do we model this problem of deciding what to do? In the future, I think we will understand the fundamental mathematical principles that allow us to train simulated agents/robots to learn their own language, skills, survival and exploration strategies without relying on reward explicitly determined by the environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>Do you have thoughts on this? Would you like to explore similar research? Drop me an email at <a href="mailto:christopher.g.willcocks@durham.ac.uk">christopher.g.willcocks@durham.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<h2 id="phds">PhD Funding</h2>
<p>Please read the <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/research-degrees/fees-and-funding/funding-your-studies/">guidelines for securing funding</a> along with other guidance such as the <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/research-degrees/how-to-apply/">entry and language requirements</a>. There are a number of ways to secure funding including Durham Doctoral Studentships (DDS) which are fully-funded 3.5 year PhD studentships. Please contact me to discuss a proposal and send me your CV along with a statement of your research interests.</p>
<p>Students can also receive scholarships from their home countries, Please see <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/scholarships/postgraduate/">the following link for more information</a> about eligibility. Alternatively, you may wish to self-fund your studies, please email me if this is something you wish to consider.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research at Durham</h2>
<p>Durham is a beautiful historic cathedral city situated in the north-east of England, where the University has long traditions but modern values. The deparment of Computer Science has a wonderful friendly and supportive culture with access to exceptional resources such as a world class supercomputer, Hamilton, and we have access to the new EPSRC Tier 2 National HPC facility (“BEDE”) hosted in Durham and operated by ARC on behalf of the N8 Universities. The department of Computer Science boasts an impressive new £40 million building (finished in 2020) and maintains our own NVIDIA Compute Center (recently upgraded with a £150,000 node of GPUs) configured for Deep Learning.</p>

<h2 id="visiting">Visiting Scholars</h2>
<p>If you are interested in a visiting position, either as an academic scholar or as a PhD student, please email me as above. I am interested in candidates with strong mathematical ability in statistics, machine learning, or geometry. Durham has particularly low living/housing/accomodation costs coupled with an exceptionally high-quality of life, and our building is designed to be accessible for parents.</p>
