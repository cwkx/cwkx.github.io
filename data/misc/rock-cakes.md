# air-fryer rock cakes 
(makes 8 rock cakes in 2 air fryer batches)

air fryer: 160 C for 16-17 mins

- 225g (1 cup) white flour
- pinch of salt
- 2 tsp of baking powder (or use 1 cup self-raising, untested)
- 75g (1/3 cup) butter
- 75g (1/3 cup) sugar (demara is OK or caster)
- 75g (1/3 cup) currents - or just split mixture and add a decent amount
- 1/4 tsp grated nutmeg (or ground cinammon)
- 1/4 tsp mixed spice
- 1 egg
- 2.5 tbsp milk (measure)

## steps
put in large mixing bowl:
- flour
- salt
- baking powder
- butter

mix with fingers to resemble breadcrumbs

combine the rest of the ingredients: 
- sugar
- spices
- egg
- milk slowly
- currents

makes a stiff VERY dry mixture (barely combines)

## cooking
air fryer: 160 C for 16-17 mins, 4 at a time (e.g. two bowls one with currents, one without)
- each batch of 4 in airfryer tear the ball in half to expose a nice rough texture to the top
- when they come out they will be soft, but when COOL they firm up to stiff rocks
- try to get a bit of gold colour on them
- tastes better when completely cool
